# first-spring-boot-project
This is a very small URL Shortener that l created so that l can dive into spring-boot
The program makes it possible to shorten a URL using an algorithm and everytime a URL is shortened a QR code is created and the URL is embedded in the QR code
It was created so that l can learn about how to create dependencies in pom.xml file and how to make use of dependencies 
ln this small project l made use of lombok and ZXING dependencies 
l also learnt about Spring Initializer, actuators to monitor performance, how dev-tools work etc
